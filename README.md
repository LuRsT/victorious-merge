Victorious Merge
----------------

Done with your feature? Got ship-its on your code review? It's time to merge
to master! And that calls for some fanfare.

This is a post-merge hook for git that will play the Final Fantasy victory
theme after a successful merge into master. Put post-merge in .git/hooks, then
put FinalFantasyVictory.mp3 into ~/lib, and finally, revel in the glory of
victory.

Requires afplay (installed by default on OS X).
